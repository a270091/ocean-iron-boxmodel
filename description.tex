\section{Overview}

This project contains matlab code to model the distribution of dissolved iron, 
phosphate and of zero, one or two organic iron-binding ligands in the ocean. 
The ocean is discretized into 12 boxes, representing main water masses in the
Atlantic and Indo-Pacific ocean. Boxes are assumed to be homogeneously mixed
and the ocean circulation is prescribed as exchanges between these boxes.

The model has been used to explore feedbacks in the ocean iron cycle
connected to organic iron complexation (manuscript in
preparation). The full model description can be found there.

The code presented here does not only contain the core model, but
several additional tools. It is grouped broadly into the the following
four parts:

\section{Code to integrate the model and to analyse ligand
  feedbacks:}

Several different versions of the box model exist, differing in the
number of modeled quantities in each box (\verb+boxmodel_po4.m+ for
example solved only one quantity, namely the phosphate concentration,
while \verb+boxmodel_po4dopfe2lig_export.m+ solves for five
quantities, namely phoshpate, dissolved organic phosphorus, iron, and
two ligands), and in whether export production is calculated from
nutrients (all models ending with \verb+_export.m+), or
prescribed.

Each of these models first calls the routine
\verb+boxmodel_init_params+ to initialize all model parameters,
including the volume of the boxes, and the mass transports between
them.

Each of the models then uses a matlab-provided routine to integrate
stiff ordinary equations to integrate the model into equilibrium,
passing the name of a routine that contains the right hand side of the
box model differential equations to this routine. These routines have
names starting with \verb+boxmodel_dgl_+.

\section*{necessary files not contained in this distribution}

Setting up the box model requires that the user has access to a small
set of netCDF files describing distribution of properties within the
ocean. All are freely downloadable from the web, but not distributed
with the model. These files are
