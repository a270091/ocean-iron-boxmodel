# ocean-iron-boxmodel
A simple box model for the geochemical cycling of iron in the ocean

This project contains matlab code to model the distribution of dissolved iron, 
phosphate and of zero, one or two organic iron-binding ligands in the ocean. 
The ocean is discretized into 12 boxes, representing main water masses in the
Atlantic and Indo-Pacific ocean. Boxes are assumed to be homogeneously mixed
and the ocean circulation is prescribed as exchanges between these boxes.
